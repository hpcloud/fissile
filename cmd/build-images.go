This command goes through all the role definitions in the role manifest creating a
Dockerfile for each of them and building it.

Each role gets a directory ` + "`<work-dir>/dockerfiles`" + `. In each directory one can find 
a Dockerfile and a directory structure that gets ADDed to the docker image. The
directory structure contains jobs, packages and all other necessary scripts and 
templates.

The images will have a 'role' label useful for filtering.
The entrypoint for each image is ` + "`/opt/hcf/run.sh`" + `.

Before running this command, you should run ` + "`fissile build layer stemcell`" + `.

The images will be tagged: ` + "`<repository>-<role_name>:<SIGNATURE>`" + `.
The SIGNATURE is based on the hashes of all jobs and packages that are included in
the image.

The --patch-properties-release flag is used to distinguish the patchProperties release/job spec
from other specs.  At most one is allowed.  Its syntax is --patch-properties-release=<RELEASE>/<JOB>.
